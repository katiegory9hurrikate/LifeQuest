<table><tr><td><samp>One of the few days I wish I had more time in class. We did not get to do the image mappiong that I wanted to do but I left it for last so we wouldn't get off track. We made some other implementations to the code that give the app a more cohesive look and feel. There was some disagreements about look-and-feel last week and it created some issues with timely implementation. Hoping to be able to implement other goals as stretch.</samp></td></tr></table>
